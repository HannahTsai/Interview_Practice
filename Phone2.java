Hannah(Ping-Shan) is an new Masters graduate from NYU with Bachelor from National Tsing Hua University (top 3 university in Taiwan). I have known her to be a caring, intelligent and diligent friend. I have seen her studied late night hours for exams and worked tirelessly as an intern for Activision Blizzard. Beyond her smarts as an SW engineer, she is one of the most caring and compassionate person that I know. She worked as a SW/Engineer instructor to High school students to teach the fundamentals of coding and help them complete challenging projects. I believe Hannah(Ping-Shan) not only possess the technical capabilities to be a successful engineer at Facebook, but she also would fit great into the Facebook culture of corporate/community responsibility conscious. She is a delight to be around and I highly recommend her for any entry SW engineering positions within Facebook.
